# Playwright Practice Project - To Do List

This project is a complete automated test suite for a web-based To-Do List application using Playwright in Java. 
It demonstrates end-to-end testing best practices by covering core user interactions and validating UI behavior reliably.

## Key Features Covered:

- Adding single and multiple todo items.
- Deleting items from the first, last, or middle of the list.
- Filtering tasks and verifying selected filters.
- Ensuring the todo list content matches expected values exactly.
- Validating UI elementsâ€™ classes, text, and visibility.

## Technical Highlights:

- Uses Playwright locators and different types of assertions (***PlaywrightAssertions*** and ***AssertJ***).
- Handles dynamic elements, hover-dependent buttons, and state changes in the UI.
- Demonstrates clean, maintainable test structure and reusable helper methods with ***Page Object Model***.

This project is ideal for showcasing practical automated testing skills, including locator strategies, assertions, and handling dynamic web content.
